# OpenCam
ESP32 combined with OpenCV is used to achieve simple machine vision recognition tasks

## Hardware
The project was originally created beacause the price of opnemv was too high and I wanted to find a cheaper alternative.
At that time, I was tring to implement a real-time image transfer project with esp32-cam development board.
